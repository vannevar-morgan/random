Random   (a.k.a. "My junk folder")
=============================================

Where I post old projects or things I think are too general (or one-offs) to post elsewhere.  Feel free to message if there's something that interests you, I love feedback - but don't expect support for things in this folder.


Repository Contents
-------------------
* **/battleship** - Command line battleship in different languages.
* **/fun_college_projects** - Some projects from college I thought were fun.
* **/n_queens** - Solution for n_queens for n = \[4, 42\] (limited by what I can print to screen)
